-- Question 1: List all entities of the given model providing the entity types and itâ€™s cardinality

-- The strong entities are:
-- Academic_staff (sub-entities Assistant and Professor)
-- Project
-- Section
-- Course

-- The cardinalities are the following:

-- Academic_staff (0,N) <Participates> (1,N) Project //Many-to-many: An academic staff may participate in 0 to N projects and a project must be associated with 1 to N academic staffs
-- Academic_staff (0,N) <Teaches> (1,1) Section //One-to-Many: A section must be taught by 1 academic staff and an academic staff may teach on 0 to N sections 
-- Section (1,1) <CouSec> (1,N) Course //One-to-Many: A section must have 1 course and a course may be given in 1 to N sections

-- Question 2: Based on the logical model, please create the necessary DDL scripts for the physical model implementation

create table section (
	semester int not null,
	year datetime not null,

	primary key (semester, year)

create table academic_course_section (
	foreign key (semester) references section(semester)
	foreign key (year) references section(year)
	foreign key (employee_no) references academic_staff(employee_no)
	foreign key (course_id) references couse(course_id)
)

-- Question 3: Based on our database model, define a MOLAP model with at least one fact and 4 dimensions

-- The dimensions could be the above tables: academic_staff, course, section and academic_course_section
-- A fact could be: "the amount of courses/sections an academic_staff teaches in a given year"
-- todo: create a star-scheme using Lucidchart
